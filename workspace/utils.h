/* This function checks that the appropriate number of command line arguments 
   were used when running the program. 
   If the appropriate number of command line arguments are not passed 
   to the command line you should print a message to stderr that tells 
   the user that there were not enough command line arguments 
   and exit the program. */

   Basically, check if the file pointer is NULL.  
   If it is NULL, print to stderr a message that states the file 
   did not open correctly and exit the program.
